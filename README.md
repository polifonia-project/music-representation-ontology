The Music Representation ontology provides a comprehensive schema to describe the analysis of musical objects (a score, an audio track, etc.) interpreted in the context of an existing theory.
Fragments of a musical object -- elements of a musical object whose temporal location is uniquely identifiable -- are described by an annotation provided by an agent, that ranges from an expert annotator to an algorithm.
An annotation is either the subjective result of an analysis (e.g. the chord played in a specific section) or objective (e.g. a note in a digital score).
Each annotation describes some music content (e.g. notes, chords, etc.), which we refer to as a musical projection, and can be composed hierarchically.
Music Representation is part of the [Polifonia ontology network](https://github.com/polifonia-project/ontology-network).

The ontology re-uses the [Music Annotation Pattern](https://github.com/andreamust/music-annotation-pattern) [1] and is aligned to the following ontologies:
* JAMS ontology [2]
* Music Note Ontology [3] (*the ontology defines domain and range axioms, a modified version that is consistent with this module is provided in ontology/music_note_refactor.owl*)
* Music Note Ontology [4]
* Music OWL [5]

## Competency questions addressed
The ontology follows the [eXtreme Design](http://extremedesign.info/) methodology for ontology development. A set of competency questions have been extracted from similar works and are listed below, alongside their provenance.

| ID | Competency question                                                                                       | Reference               |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1  | Which are the metrics defining the fragment of the score part?                                            | Music Note Ontology [4] |
| 2  | What is the duration in seconds of a musical object in a given performance?                               | Music Note Ontology [4] |
| 3  | What part of the score does a note belong to?                                                             | Music Note Ontology [4] |
| 4  | What are the dynamic indications referring to a note in the score?                                        | Music Note Ontology [4] |
| 5  | What is the duration in seconds of a note in a given performance?                                         | Music Note Ontology [4] |
| 6  | Which are the accidental of the notes present in a score part?                                            | Music Note Ontology [4] |
| 7  | Which are the fragments of a piece that are of a duration(s) X?                                           | MusicOWL [5]            |
| 8  | Which are the fragments of a piece that use the note(s) X?                                                | MusicOWL [5]            |
| 9  | Which are the fragments of a piece that use the note(s) X and duration(s) Y?                              | MusicOWL [5]            |
| 10 | Which are the fragments of a piece that use the note(s) X and duration(s) Y distributed over Z measures?  | MusicOWL [5]            |
| 11 | Which are the compositions containing chords composed of X notes?                                         | MusicOWL [5]            |

The ontology development reuses estabilished Ontology Design Patterns, which can be found at [ontologydesignpatterns.org](ontologydesignpatterns.org/) and are described in the figure below.
